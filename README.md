# multicraft-zabbix
This is everything (maybe?) you need to monitor multicraft servers with zabbix.

It has support for automatically detecting different server instances and setting up graphs for online players, cpu load, and tps/tick rates. 

Be kind, I'm not a coder and I did this in my spare time so I know there are bugs and that the code is ugly.
